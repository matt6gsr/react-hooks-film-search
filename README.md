## React Hooks Film Search

This ReactJS project is a small film search app displaying the use of React Hooks, in particular useState, useReducer and useEffect in functional components instead of using complex class components. It uses the [OMDB](http://www.omdbapi.com/) api to retrive the results of the search. The api returns a maximum of 10 results. I followed a tutorial to teach myself these new additions to the ReactJS framework, however I refactored where possible and added changes like a spinner, also converting this spinner into a hook.
